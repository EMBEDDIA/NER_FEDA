# Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation for NER

This is the code related to the paper [Using a frustratingly easy domain and tagset adaptation for creating slavic named entity recognition systems](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.bsnlp-1.12/). It is a NER system which applies a Frustrantinglu Easy Domain Adaptation model not only to increase the data available for training the models but also for changing the possible tagset used to annotate.
